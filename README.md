# Face and Eye Tracking using OpenCV
## Description
- Computer vision plays a big role in our lives. Nowadays it is difficult to find a project that does not include computer vision. Pensf is a very important tool in building computer vision applications. One of the most popular tasks is face and eye tracking which involves identifying the location of features and faces of people in images and videos.
- This project is based on Haar cascade classifiers. The classifier is a pre-trained machine learning model that has been trained to detect faces and eyes.
- I hope you try the project and enjoy the power of computer vision.
